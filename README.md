***Abnormality Detection and Predictions on Unseen Diseases in Chest X-ray Images***

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused enormous challenges for medical experts in identifying the abnormalities from radiography images due to the lack of pre-labeled training data. The recent need to analyze radiography images efficiently without pre-labeled unseen diseases is essential in helping combat future pandemics
and reduce the burden on society. In this paper, we study the use of several
Computer Vision and Deep Learning models for the tasks of abnormality detection
and unseen disease prediction. Our goal is to explore the possibility of utilizing
previously trained models to detect abnormal regions and predict new, unseen
diseases in chest X-ray images.
